# Mateusz-Turek-Scandiweb-entry-test

This is my e-shop project in which I am using:
- react
- redux to manage the state
- graphql to fetch data
- Scandiweb's endpoint that I am using : https://github.com/scandiweb/junior-react-endpoint

During working on this assigment I took into account the guidelines provided to me in this link:
